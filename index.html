        <p class="card-result-means__description">
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
          healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
          such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
          fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
          strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
          five days a week.

          certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
